<h1>Tasks#index</h1>
<p>Find me in app/views/tasks/index.html.erb</p>

<!-- Should display a list of all tasks and, for each task:
a link to its show view (use a link_to helper)
a link to its edit view
a link to its delete action. Hint: a standard link does not allow to perform DELETE request, so here you should add a method: :delete option to your link_to helper.
Should include a link to the new view to create a new task -->
<% @tasks.each do |task| %>
  <h2><%= link_to task.title, task_path(task) %></h2>
  <p><%= link_to "Edit", edit_task_path(task) %></p>
  <p><%= link_to "Delete", task_path(task), method: :delete %></p>
<% end %>
